### Caesar Cipher Encryptor 

A simple C++ program for encrypting text using a Caesar cipher.

### How to build
If on windows run `build.bat` it will generate a `bin` folder with the binary. **(MinGW necessary)**
If on linux or mac compile the source code to generate the binary. **(gcc or clang necessary)**

## Usage
1. Enter the plaintext when prompted.
2. Input the key (shift amount) for encryption.
3. Obtain the encrypted text.

## How it Works
The program takes user input for plaintext and a key, then performs encryption using a Caesar cipher algorithm.
